# Student Performance Prediction Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Workflow Protocol

This project follows a **PHASE-BY-PHASE LEARNING APPROACH**. Each phase must be completed in this exact order:

### Phase Workflow Cycle:
1. **STUDY** - Read and understand the phase study document
2. **DOCUMENT** - Review/create detailed study materials before implementation
3. **IMPLEMENT** - Code the phase requirements
4. **TEST** - Validate implementation works correctly
5. **CONCLUDE** - Create conclusion document summarizing learnings
6. **PROCEED** - Only then move to next phase

### Phase Structure:
- **Study Document Location**: `docs/phase_studies/Phase_XX_Name.md`
- **Conclusion Document Location**: `docs/phase_conclusions/Phase_XX_Conclusion.md`
- **Implementation Location**: `notebooks/XX_phase_name.ipynb`

### Documentation Requirements:

#### Study Documents Must Include:
- Detailed conceptual explanations
- Mathematical foundations with formulas
- Code snippets for understanding (not full implementations)
- Visual diagrams where helpful
- Key terminology definitions
- Practical considerations for our dataset
- Learning objectives and goals

#### Conclusion Documents Must Include:
- Summary of what was implemented
- Key learnings and insights
- Challenges faced and solutions
- Results and metrics achieved
- Visualizations created
- Questions answered
- Preparation for next phase

### Coding Standards:

1. **Simple Solutions First** - Avoid over-engineering
2. **No Code Duplication** - Reuse functions across notebooks
3. **Clean and Organized** - Well-commented, readable code
4. **Learning-Focused** - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
5. **Test Everything** - Validate each step works
6. **Document Assumptions** - Make implicit knowledge explicit

### Project-Specific Rules:

1. **Dataset**: Working with Math course dataset (`student-mat.csv`)
2. **Target Variable**: Predicting G3 (final grade) using all features including G1, G2
3. **Approach**: Implementation from scratch first, then compare with sklearn
4. **Focus**: Deep understanding over quick results

### File Organization:

- Keep notebooks under 300 lines - refactor to `src/` modules if needed
- Save all plots to `reports/figures/` with descriptive names
- Document all data transformations
- Version control all code changes

### Phase Transition Rules:

- **NEVER** skip to next phase without completing current phase cycle
- **ALWAYS** create conclusion document before moving forward
- **MUST** test implementation thoroughly before concluding
- **REQUIRE** explicit confirmation to proceed to next phase

### Quality Checklist (Before Phase Conclusion):

- [ ] Study document exists and is comprehensive
- [ ] Implementation is complete and tested
- [ ] Code is clean and well-commented
- [ ] Results are documented with visualizations
- [ ] Conclusion document is written
- [ ] All deliverables for phase are met
- [ ] Learning objectives achieved

## Current Project Status:

- **Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Initial Setup
- **Next Phase**: Phase 1 - Data Collection & Understanding
- **Dataset**: Student Math Performance (649 students, 33 attributes)
- **Target**: G3 (final grade, 0-20 scale)

**Remember**: This is a LEARNING project. Take time to understand deeply, not just implement quickly.
